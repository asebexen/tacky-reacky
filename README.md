# React Tacky demo
(If you stumbled upon this by accident, it's currently not ready! Check back later.)
This is just a little demonstration of my Tic Tac Toe library, tacky, being used in React.  
To run the dev server, `npm i` packages if necessary, then `npm run dev`.  
Nothing terribly fancy, just wanted to prove to you (and to myself) that this thing works and stuff. :)
