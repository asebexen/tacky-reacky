# React Tacky demo
Hey hey! Go and check out the deployed version [here](https://spontaneous-sundae-ae1826.netlify.app/).
This is just a little demonstration of my Tic Tac Toe library, tacky, being used in React.  
To run the dev server, `npm i` packages if necessary, then `npm run dev`.  
Nothing terribly fancy, just wanted to prove to you (and to myself) that this thing works and stuff. :)
